    "In Python, both def statements and lambda expressions are used to create functions, but they have some key differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) With def, you define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and a block of code enclosed\n",
    "   in curly braces. It's typically used for creating named functions.     \n",
    "   With lambda, you create anonymous functions using the lambda keyword, which takes a list of parameters and an expression. \n",
    "   The result of the expression is the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) def statements are used to define functions that are intended for reuse throughout your code. They're more flexible and can \n",
    "   contain multiple statements and complex logic.  \n",
    "   lambda expressions are mainly used for creating small, inline functions where defining a named function is unnecessary or   \n",
    "   cumbersome. They're often used in functional programming constructs like map, filter, and reduce, or in situations where a \n",
    "   simple function is needed as an argument to another function.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3) def statements allow for the use of descriptive function names, making the code more readable and understandable.   \n",
    "   lambda expressions create anonymous functions, which can make the code harder to read, especially if the expression is complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Functions defined with def can contain multiple statements and have access to variables in the enclosing scope.    \n",
    "   lambda functions are restricted to a single expression and can only access variables in their own scope and the global scope."

    "1) Conciseness: Lambda functions allow you to write small, inline functions without needing to define them using the def keyword. This can make your code more concise and readable, especially for simple operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Functional Programming: Lambdas are commonly used in functional programming paradigms where functions are treated as first-class citizens. They can be passed as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Anonymous Functions: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't require a name. This is useful when you need a function for a short period of time and don't want to define a named function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Readability: While they can make code more concise, excessive use of lambda functions might decrease readability, particularly for complex operations. However, for simple transformations or filtering operations, lambda functions can enhance readability by keeping the code closer to the data it operates on."

    "1) Function Naming: Choose descriptive and concise names that reflect the purpose of the function. Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (snake_case).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Function Length: Keep functions short and focused on a single task. If a function is too long, consider breaking it into smaller functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Function Documentation: Provide clear and concise docstrings to explain what the function does, its parameters, return values, and any side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Parameter Passing: Pass parameters as arguments to functions rather than relying on global variables. This improves readability and makes functions more reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Return Values: Functions should return a meaningful value, if applicable. Avoid using return values for control flow (use exceptions or flags instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully within functions. Use exceptions to signal and handle errors rather than returning special error codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Side Effects: Minimize side effects within functions. Functions should ideally operate only on their inputs and produce outputs, without modifying global variables or affecting external state.\n",
